# CS480 Capstone Project

This app was created for my capstone project with the intent of providing convenient public education surrounding the conservation of sea turtles in the Jekyll Island, Georgia region. All information contained within this website was obtained by authorative sources including the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, and the Georgia Sea Turtle Center.

The web app is hosted here: https://csc480capstoneproject.pages.dev/
