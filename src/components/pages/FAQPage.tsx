        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-lotus-eden">How Can I Find Sea Turtle Nests?</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
        During nesting season, female sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs in a nest called a “body pit.” It’s common to see sea turtle tracks leading from the ocean to the dry patch of sand where the body pit was constructed—an easy way to determine where sea turtle nests are located. You can also view a variety of nest monitoring resources to find out where sea turtle nests in the area are located.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-lotus-eden">How Does Light Impact The Well-Being Of Hatchling Sea Turtles?</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
        Once hatched, baby sea turtles journey from the shore to the ocean. Hatchlings rely on moonlight to find their way from the nest back to the ocean. Unfortunately, they can be easily thrown off course by bright flashlights, lights on beachside property or beach chairs and furniture too close to their nest.
